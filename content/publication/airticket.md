# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "The air transport demand is directly related to economic cycles (domestic and international), to the currency fluctuations andexchange and to the performance of economies. The airline industry performance can be used as a measure of the economicheating level. This sector is highly capital intensive and energy based, being an essential tool in acountry’sproduction chain, asit relates different areas. This paper seeks to determine whether there is a long-term equilibrium between the demand forairline tickets, its prices, and macroeconomic indicators–such as GDP and fuel prices in Brazil. The analysis focuses onthedemand of airlines TAM, Gol (and VARIG) and Web Jet, which together represents about 85% of domestic passengertransportation. Results states that economic growth is oneof the key factors on airport infrastructure capacity pressure,however the long run price parameter has a low intensity, which reflects the business travel passenger type dominance inBrazilian air transportation."
