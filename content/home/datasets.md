Experience with large datasets, including data from household surveys. 

Had to combine several datasets - with around 50 million lines each and 15 GB each - by an unique identification number.

Used SQL procedures in SAS (PROC SQL) for data extraction and manipulation due to the size and complexity of the datasets.
